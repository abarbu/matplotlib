== matplotlib ==

This is a Chicken Scheme egg which provides an interface to
[http://matplotlib.org matplotlib].

It lets you build up a plot and then render it onto the screen, render
it to a file, or generate Python code.

Largely undocumented for now

==== High-level ====

: (mplot-run-onscreen plot)
: (mplot-run-code plot)
: (mplot-run-figure filename plot)

Given a plot it either runs it onscreen, prints out the Python code,
or writes it out to a file.
